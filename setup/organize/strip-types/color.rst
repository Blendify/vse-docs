G. Color strip
==============

The Color strip is a sequence of 25 frames with a solid color. Its Duration is set by the same mechanism as the Image strip. The resolution is derived from the Project Settings and by default takes the complete movie screen area.

You'll use this strip heavily to create some custom transitions and in combination with the Crop and/or Transform property to create some horizontal or vertical colored bars.

The Compositing, Transform, Crop, Video, Color, Time, and Custom panels are unchanged. An Effect panel is added to the Properties. The existing Color panel has some overlap with the Effect panel. The Time panel has no Strip Offset and Hold Offset properties.

With the vertical slider you can set the brightness of the color. Clicking on the horizontal slider will display a standard Color Picker.
