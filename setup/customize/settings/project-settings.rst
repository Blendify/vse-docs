   Figure 1: Project Settings

The Project Settings for your video project are grouped in the `Output Properties <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/render/output/index.html>`_ tab of the Properties Editor. This editor is located at the top right area in the default Video Editing workspace. They are shared with the other modules, e.g. 3D modeling.

The most important settings are:

* Dimensions panel
  
  * Resolution X, Y: The number of pixels horizontally and vertically in the image.
  * Frame Rate: How many frames will be displayed per second.

* Output panel

  * File path: The location to save rendered frames.
  * Format: Based on which format is used, other options such as channels, bit depth and compression level are available.

The different options are described more in depth at the `Render Output <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/render/output/index.html>`_ section of the manual.
